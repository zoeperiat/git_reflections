When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you collaborate or work on different locations 
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   sometimes you don't want to push things as it's not yet ready to be reviewed by others.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone: copying a repository from remote to local (no connection). „A clone is simply a 	copy of a repository.“
    Forks: copying a repository to your remote from another remote. „Taking the source 		code and work on it yourself separate from the original code.“ 
    Branch: checkout master branch. „ A branch is something that is within a repository. 	Conceptually, it represents a thread of development.“

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	In case you want to work on it while being offline and you still want to profit from latest changes. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

	+ you would not need gitHub
	- manual checking of differences 
	- reviews harder 
	

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

  	- when people work simultaniously on a project
	- to ensure nothing is merged that has impact on others work —> to enable pull requests
	- for risky changes that should not directly impact the master
